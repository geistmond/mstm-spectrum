=============================
Multi Spheres T-matrix Studio
=============================

Python wrapper for multiple sphere T-matrix (`MSTM <http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2011.02.019>`_) code and Mie theory to calculate surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrum and fit it to experiment.

Features
========

* Materials defined from constant expression, from tabulated file or from analytical formula of `Rioux et al <http://doi.org/10.1002/adom.201300457>`_ for Au-Ag;
* Simple functional contributions (linear, lorentzian, gaussian)
* Mie theory contributions
* MSTM calculations: spectra and near-field intensity
* Fitting of experimental data by any of the mentioned contributions, including combinations
* Interactive graphical user interface
* Flexible Python scripting
